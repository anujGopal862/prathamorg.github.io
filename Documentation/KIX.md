# **KIX&quot; Computerized Adaptive Testing**

**Objective:**  Create Computerized Adaptive Testing platform for student assessment

**Concept:**  Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a form of computer-based test that adapts to the examinee&#39;s ability level. It is a form of computer-administered test in which the next item or set of items selected to be administered depends on the correctness of the test taker&#39;s responses to the most recent items administered.

**Issues addressed:**  Linear testing frameworks follow the same sequence of questions in student assessments. On the other hand, Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) adapts to the candidate&#39;s ability to produce the next question. This helps to better assess the candidate&#39;s abilities. CATs have higher accuracy and efficiency in predicting a candidate&#39;s abilities than a linear test.

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Conceptualization - devise different types of approaches to build CAT | CAT Expertise | In-progress |
| Develop item matrix that contains items along with their parameters required to build CAT | Item Response Theory | Not Started |
| Develop the CAT model for candidate&#39;s proficiency estimation | CAT Expertise | Not Started |
| Deploy the CAT model on an android app and test it will real users | Android Development | Not Started |

**Details:**  Computerized adaptive tests are educational evaluations, usually taken by examinees in a computer or some other digital means, in which the examinee&#39;s proficiency is evaluated after the response of each item. The new proficiency is then used to select a new item, closer to the examinee&#39;s real proficiency. This method of test application has several advantages compared to the traditional paper-and-pencil method or even linear tests applied electronically, since high-proficiency examinees are not required to answer all the easy items in a test, answering only the items that actually give some information regarding his or hers true knowledge of the subject at matter. A similar, but inverse effect happens for those examinees of low proficiency level.

**Progress** :

- Explored the Concerto open source platform for computerized adaptive tests. However, it did not fit well for our requirements as it does not work offline
- Exploring Multi Stage testing
