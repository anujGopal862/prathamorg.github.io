title: Knowledge Graph of Educational Concepts
tags: [Natural Language Understanding]
---

**Objective** : Developing knowledge graph of educational concepts which can be used to build a video recommendation system

**Concept** : Extract concepts from school textbooks and create a graphical representation of the relationship between these concepts

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text generation for a concept using Wikipedia API | | Completed|
| Entity and triplets extraction from the text |  | Done |
| Knowledge Graph creation for extracted triplets from text | | Done |
| Evaluation of the knowledge graph | | Done |
| Knowledge graph creation for Pratham Open School videos using video titles which would be passed to the Wiki API | | In progress |
| Knowledge graph creation for Pratham Open School videos using video transcripts which would be passed to the Wiki API | | To be Done |
| Building  a recommendation engine using the knowledge graph generated | | To be Done |
| Development of the knowledge graph using the evaluated technique for all subjects | | No started |

**Details** : Knowledge graph serves as an integrated information repository that interlinks heterogeneous data from different domains. A knowledge graph can be created by extracting concepts from school textbooks and finding links between them to create a graphical representation of the concepts. These interlinked concepts can be used to create a recommendation system for online educational videos to recommend videos of relevant topics to students.
