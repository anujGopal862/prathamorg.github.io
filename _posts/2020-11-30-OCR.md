**Objective** : Developing an Optical Character Recognition tool to convert the images of answers to text for evaluation

**Concept** : To evaluate answers of students handwritten on paper, the image of the page need to be converted into text. This process can be automated to save the human efforts by using a optical character recongnization tool that converts images to text.

**Project Plan:**
