**Objective** : Developing an Optical Character Recognition tool to convert the images of answers to text for evaluation

**Concept** : To evaluate answers of students handwritten on paper, the image of the page need to be converted into text. This process can be automated to save the human efforts by using a optical character recongnization tool that converts images to text.

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Testing available OCR libraries and API's such as Pytesseract and Google Cloud Vision on English and Hindi Text Containing Images| | Done |
| Evaluation of performance of different OCR tools on Hindi and English text containing images | Image Processing, OCR | Done  |
| Testing the Azure Read API  | Image Processing, OCR | To be done |
| Data Collection for custom training an OCR Model | Data Collection | Not Started |
| Nueral Network model identification for training on English and Hindi text containing images | Research | In progress |

**Details:**
We tested the various OCR tools such as pytesseract and google cloud vision on our existing hindi an english text containing images. The outputs for both tools were not up to the mark for both hindi and english. There is a singnificant variation in the quality of existing images and new data needs to be collected for custom training an OCR model from scratch. The Azure Read API would be tested on the existing images and its performance would be evaluated.
