title: Confidence Detection
tags: [Audio Feature Extraction]
---

**Objective** : To detect confidence of a child based on their audio samples using Audio based Deep Learning models 

**Concept** : Children can enhance their confidence in speaking skills using personalised feedbacks and regular practice, which would impact their overall development

**Issues addressed:**  Confidence and attitude play an essential role in public speaking. Confidence allows children to speak with clarity and manage their thoughts better. Lack of confidence is one of the major problems in children hindering their overall personality development. Through an web/app based platform, they can upload their audio and get personalised feedback based on their presentation. These feedbacks will further add to their development and eventually boost their confidence.

**Details** : The web/app developed for confidence detection allows a child to upload their audio samples and then provides them the confidence score and feedback that they should work on. It can be used as a model to assess confidence of a child in various interventions/programs/activities and can be clubbed with other applications.

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data collection - collect audio samples of  different children (labeled data) | Android Development | In-Progress |
| Develop and test Deep Learning Models to assess confidence of the child using analysis of their audio samples | Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms | In-Progress |
| Conceptualize and integrate the designed ML model with an Android app. To make API call to get detailed info about confidence of a child (Deployment) | Android Development | Not Started |
